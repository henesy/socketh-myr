# SocketH - Myrddin

An implementation of [SocketH](https://github.com/henesy/SocketH) in [Myrddin](https://myrlang.org). 

## Requirements

This is broken on Linux/amd64, I don't know why. Patches and insight are welcome. 

This seems to work fine on 9front/amd64. 

## Build

To build a given project:

	mbld

## Run

From a built project:

	./obj/$binary

where $binary is the project name.
